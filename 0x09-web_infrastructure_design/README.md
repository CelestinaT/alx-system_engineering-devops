0x09. Web infrastructure design
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Learning Objective: DNS, Monitoring, Web Server, Network basics, Load balancer, Server, draw a diagram covering the web stack you built with the sysadmin/devops track projects, explain what each component is doing, explain system redundancy and understand these acronyms: LAMP, SPOF, QPS

Tasks
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0. Simple web stack: design a one server web infrastructure that hosts the website that is reachable via www.foobar.com. Use: 1 server, 1 web server (Nginx), 1 application server, 1 application files (your code base), 1 database (MySQL), 1 domain name foobar.com configured with a www record that points to your server IP 8.8.8.8  Repo: GitHub repository: alx-system_engineering-devops Directory: 0x09-web_infrastructure_design File: 0-simple_web_stack
1. Distributed web infrastructure: design a three server web infrastructure that hosts the website www.foobar.com. Add: 2 servers, 1 web server (Nginx), 1 application server, 1 load-balancer (HAproxy), 1 set of application files (your code base), 1 database (MySQL) Repo: GitHub repository: alx-system_engineering-devops Directory: 0x09-web_infrastructure_design File: 1-distributed_web_infrastructure
2. Secured and monitored web infrastructure: design a three server web infrastructure that hosts the website www.foobar.com, it must be secured, serve encrypted traffic, and be monitored. Add: 3 firewalls, 1 SSL certificate to serve www.foobar.com over HTTPS, 3 monitoring clients (data collector for Sumologic or other monitoring services) Repo: GitHub repository: alx-system_engineering-devops Directory: 0x09-web_infrastructure_design File: 2-secured_and_monitored_web_infrastructure
3. Scale up: Readme, Application server vs web server Add: 1 server, 1 load-balancer (HAproxy) configured as cluster with the other one, Split components (web server, application server, database) with their own server Repo:GitHub repository: alx-system_engineering-devops Directory: 0x09-web_infrastructure_design File: 3-scale_up
